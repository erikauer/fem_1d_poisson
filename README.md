# fem_1d_poisson
Basic Matlab example of solving the 1 dimensional poisson equation with FEM (=Finite element method)

## Introduction
Tutorial to get a basic understanding about implementing FEM using MATLAB. In this example we want to solve the poisson
equation with homogeneous boundary values.

## Mathematical Problem
We want to solve following mathematical problem - 1 dimensional poisson equation with homogeneous dirichlet boundary condition:

Befor we start the implementation we need to do some math ;). We need to derive a weak formulation of the Equations above.
So lets start ...

## Weak formulation
